# HanChar Project

HanChar is a mobile application that is designed to recognize Japanese Kanji based on the user strokes and provide additional information of the selected kanji. 

HanChar uses machine learning to recognize images and return the best 8 possible results to the user, where a selected result displays some information such as meaning, pronunciations, stroke order and example words (with audio).

This is the integrative project Team 3 of Tecnologico de Monterrey, required for graduation in Computer Science.
